# ⚖️ Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy vs API Gateway

Understanding the difference between a **Load Balancer**, **Reverse Proxy**, and **API Gateway** is essential for designing scalable, secure, and high-performance systems—especially in **cloud** and **microservices** architectures.

---

## 🔹 Load Balancer (LB)

**Purpose:**  
Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple backend servers to improve availability and reliability.

### 📌 Key Characteristics
- Distributes traffic uniformly across servers
- Works at:
  - **Layer 4 (TCP)**
  - **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**

### 🎯 Use Cases
- High-traffic websites
- Failover and high availability
- Horizontal scaling

### ✅ Pros
- Improves fault tolerance
- Handles traffic spikes
- Enables seamless scaling

### ❌ Cons
- Can become a single point of failure without redundancy

### 🛠️ Examples
- HAProxy
- AWS ELB / ALB / NLB
- Nginx

---

## 🔹 Reverse Proxy (RP)

**Purpose:**  
Sits between clients and servers, forwarding requests while hiding backend server details.

### 📌 Key Characteristics
- Forwards client requests to backend servers
- Works primarily at **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**

### 🎯 Use Cases
- SSL/TLS termination
- Caching
- Access control for public-facing APIs

### ✅ Pros
- Improves performance
- Adds security
- Enables content filtering and routing

### ❌ Cons
- Adds additional network latency

### 🛠️ Examples
- Nginx
- Apache HTTP Server
- HAProxy (as reverse proxy)

---

## 🔹 API Gateway

**Purpose:**  
Acts as a **single entry point** for APIs, routing requests to the correct backend services.

### 📌 Key Characteristics
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Works at **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**

### 🎯 Use Cases
- Microservices architectures
- Mobile and web APIs
- Centralized API management

### ✅ Pros
- Centralized API entry point
- Handles authentication & authorization
- Supports rate limiting and throttling

### ❌ Cons
- Adds latency and operational complexity
- Can become a bottleneck if not scaled properly

### 🛠️ Examples
- Kong
- AWS API Gateway
- Apigee
- Tyk

## 📊 Quick Comparison

| Feature | Load Balancer | Reverse Proxy | API Gateway |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Primary Role | Traffic distribution | Request forwarding | API management |
| OSI Layer | L4 / L7 | L7 | L7 |
| Security Features | Limited | Moderate | Advanced |
| Auth & Rate Limiting | ❌ | ❌ / Limited | ✅ |
| Microservices Friendly | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |

---

## 🚀 When to Use What?

- **Use Load Balancer** → For scaling and high availability  
- **Use Reverse Proxy** → For security, SSL termination, and caching  
- **Use API Gateway** → For microservices and API-centric systems  

> In modern architectures, these components are often **used together**, not as replacements.
